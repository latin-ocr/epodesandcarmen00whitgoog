Verses are either simple or compound. A simple
verse is one consisting of feet of the same kind or their
legitimate representatives. A compound verse is one in
which a verse of one kind is subjoined to a verse of a
different kind, this latter being termed the “Base '⁹
(βάσις, in the meaning of “a foundation ’'-).

A verse written in διποδία (except the Anapaestic),
or in seet of four syllables, and complete in itself‚ having
nothing wanting and nothing over, is called acatalectr'c
