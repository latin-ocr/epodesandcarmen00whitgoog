*Fon sonte long time past it has been widely felt

that a reduction in the cost of Classical Works

, used in schools generally, and more especially in
those intended for boys of the middle classes, is
at once desirable and not difficult of accomplish·
ment. For the most part only portions os authors

· are read in the earlier stages oreducation, anda
pupil is taken from one work to another in each
successive half-year or term; so that a book
needlessly large and proportionably expensive is
laid aside after a short and but partia] use.

In order, therefore, to meet what is certainly a
want, Portions os the Classical Writers usually
read in Schools are now being issued under the
title of GRAMMAR Scuoou Taxus3 while, at the
request of various Masters, it has been determined
to add to the series some portions of the Greek
T eslament.

Each ΤΕΧΤ is provided with a VOCABULARv ol
the words occurring in it. ln every instance—with
the exception of Eut tropius and AEsop-the origin
of a word, when knowns rs stated athre commem-
ment of the article treatmo ot ttsrl mmmm*
